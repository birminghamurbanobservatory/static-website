From past experience we know that following intense heat and warmth we often experience thunderstorms in the UK. For the past few days (and continuing) we have been recording lots of lightning strikes all across the country with them giving some spectacular views across Birmingham and its surroundings. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Displayed here are the amount of strikes per 5 minutes for the [Thinktank weather station](https://data.birminghamurbanobservatory.com/plot?ancestorPlatforms__includes=thinktank&observedProperty=lightning-count&unit=count&customWindow=3-days) (one of our own stations) on the evening of the 12th August. Between 8:15pm and 8:20pm, 42 strikes were recorded in the vicinity!

#But what is lightning?
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Thunderstorms and lightning are commonly associated with those big, tall cumulonimbus clouds and are the result of instability within the atmosphere. Within the clouds hail and ice crystals form and as they move around and collide with each other, electrons are displaced and a build-up of opposite negatively-charged and positively-charged particles develops. As they are lighter, the positively charged particles are lifted to the top of the cloud whilst heavier negative particles sink to the lower parts. Eventually, when the difference becomes too large, a charge will propagate between the two in the form of lightning. This can be a cloud-to-cloud strike, a cloud-to-air strike or a cloud-to-ground strike.

The lightning is the visual display of this charge and the thunder which follows is the noise created by it. This noise is due to the fast expansion of the air nearby as it is heated rapidly. As light travels faster than sound, this explains why we will see lightning before we hear it. 


#Where can I see where lightning strikes are occurring? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

As lightning storms tend to occur more frequently in hotter regions, in between the tropics tend to experience the highest frequency of lightning strikes. 
However as I am sure you are aware we can also get them here in the UK, particularly in the warmer months. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
At the University of Birmingham we are currently in the process of getting a lightning detector installed on our library roof. This BTD-200 Lightning Warning System will detect any lightning strike occurences up to a 35km (22 miles) distance from the sensor which will cover a large area of Birmingham and the surroundings. Keep an eye on our [website](https://birminghamurbanobservatory.com/) to keep up to date with when this happens.

For the time being however, an interesting website is [Blitzortung](https://www.blitzortung.org/en/live_lightning_maps.php). Described as a ‘worldwide, real time, community and collaborative lightning location network’, it shows live lightning strikes on a world map as they occur. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
For a more UK specific outlook, the Met Office have a [real time observations map](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/observation/map/#?map=Lightning&fcTime=1597283100&zoom=7&lon=-0.70&lat=52.25) which can show you recent lightning strikes across the country.

However, for some over the next few days, the best place to see lightning strikes may be outside your own window!
