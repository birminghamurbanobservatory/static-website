Towards the end of summer our meteorological site, located at Elms Cottage (Edgbaston) had an upgrade! With winter on its way and our notorious British weather constantly bringing us surprises we wanted to make sure we were getting continuous and correct measurements for a number of meteorological variables. 

With the help of [Campbell Scientific](https://www.campbellsci.co.uk), a company which specialises in the supply and fitting of specialist scientific equipment, the met site got a thorough sprucing up and check over. As you can see it is now looking very fresh!

The observations from our Elms Cottage site can be seen on Campbell Scientific's software called Konnect. Here is the link to [real time observations](https://app.konectgds.com/kiosk/c8c55446-9283-4acc-94c1-4a2ff81b6186):

We hope to keep maintaining and improving the site at Elms Cottage so we can continually monitor the weather at the University of Birmingham as accurately as possible. This data will feed into a number of our projects which we are creating within Birmingham Urban Observatory and may also be used to help other fellow researchers and students at the University. 

The site also serves as a reference for testing other weather stations such as the [Netatmo](https://www.netatmo.com/en-gb/weather) anemometer shown below.
