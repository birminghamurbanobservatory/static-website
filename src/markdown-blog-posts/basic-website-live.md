Our basic website is now live, well of course it is, you're looking at it! 

It presents information about the Urban Observatory and details on how you can get in touch with us. We'll try our best to add interesting updates, and any findings, to this blog section.

We're still working on the website for visualising and downloading the data we've collected from across the city. Keep an eye on our [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/BhamUrbanObs) for updates.

These static webpages were built using the fantastic [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) framework and have been styled with the help of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
