April has now been announced as the UKâ€™s sunniest April on record by the Met Office recording approximately 172% of April sunshine compared to the long term average (1981-2010). It was also reported to be an extremely dry month with most areas of the UK reporting below average rainfall for the time of year. 

As mentioned in the last blog post found [here](./joys-of-april), Birmingham also received similarly dry and warm conditions for much of April predominantly due to persistent high pressure situated over the UK. 


Looking at our data from the Elms cottage meteorological site located at the University of Birmingham campus, it can be seen that surface pressure levels were also relatively high for much of the month. The exception to this was during the last week of April when a series of low pressure systems swept in from the west bringing heavy showers at times.
