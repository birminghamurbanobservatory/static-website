As mentioned in a previous blog (link) the Urban Observatory at the University of Birmingham are working alongside Campbell Scientific to install brand new ClimaVUE50 weather stations fitted at numerous locations across Birmingham. These stations measure a number of meteorological features from average temperature to relative humidity, rainfall to wind speed and much more. With 19 stations previously fitted we are now lucky enough to have another 5 to add to our collection!
