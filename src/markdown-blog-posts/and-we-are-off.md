The Birmingham Urban Observatory project is officially under way.

Birmingham is one of three _Phase 2_ Universities to join the list of _UKCRIC Urban Observatories_, which now totals 6 (Phase 1: Newcastle, Sheffield, Bristol; Phase 2: Birmingham, Manchester, Cranfield).

Over, at least, the next 2 years we'll be busy deploying sensors across Birmingham to gain insights into the UK's second largest city. Stay tuned for more info.
